@section main_intro Introduction

The audio files of <em>Star Wars: Knights of the Old Republic</em> and <em>Star Wars: Knights of the Old Republic II -- The Sith Lords</em> (<em>KOTOR</em>) contain extra headers of what seem to be superfluous data that obfuscate access to the original audio outside of the video games. Most audio software will refuse to open the files, or interpret the extra bytes as audio data, leading to glitches. It has also been observed anecdotally that files lacking an appropriate header may fail to playback in certain releases of the games.

%SithCodec is an application that can automatically detect and remove an extraneous header from a <em>KOTOR</em> audio file, or alternatively prepend a <em>KOTOR</em> header to a standard audio file and allow for the introduction of new audio content to these games.
